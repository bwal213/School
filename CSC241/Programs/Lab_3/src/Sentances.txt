This is a sentance.
This is also a sentance.
This file will contain twenty sentances.
There was a requirement for twenty sentances.
Without having twenty sentances there would not be enough of a test.
This is a test for storing words.
To only store one of each word and thier location.
This way it should take less memory.
There is no guarantee that it will take less memory.
I hope to find a efficient solution. 
To be efficient is not just about memory.
It must also limit processor usage.
If the processor does all the work then that is no good.
If the memory does all the work then that is no good.
To find a solution that uses both the least is good.
The solution must be quick and efficient.
If it is not quick that is no good.
I wonder how I will solve this.
I hope it does not take too long.
I do not have much time.
