During the development of this program, it went mostly smoothly. I was able to modify my code from the poker hand program, and get it to shuffle and build a deck of cards. My only issue I encountered was when I had to deal with the Ace case, and solving it required me to create a public boolean variable (that probably could have been private), to know if I already used an ace. If the total of the hand was too high, it auto switched the ace to a 1, but if I had already used an ace, I needed to account for that. By using this boolean, I was able to then know if I had used one and switch it to a 1 if necessary. I also needed to use .equals() for my string comparison, as java still doesn't like to cooperate otherwise.
