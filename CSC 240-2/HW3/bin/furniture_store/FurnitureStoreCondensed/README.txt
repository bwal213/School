For this program, it went mostly smoothly. I had some issues getting the toString() methods to behave, and had to cooperate with them, causing code that doesn't do anything other than appease java to be included. Other than that it was mostly straight forward. I had some issues getting the Scanner working, and did not make sure non int values are ignored. I had some issues getting the number of dining table vs number of armchairs to work as well, but once that was taken care of, it seemed to work as required. Most of the program is never used, but is there to fulfill the requirement. This program would be better when connected to a system that has the product data.
