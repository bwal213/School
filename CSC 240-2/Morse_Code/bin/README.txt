This program was relativly easy to get working. The setup for the different conversions took the most time, due to needing to enter everything then enter it again reveresed so that it can go between english to morse and morse to english. The next issue I ran into was getting the 7 spaces between words to be detected correctly, since beween letters it naturally wants to just look at it like that, but I needed to force it to look at it as consecutive spaces, which took some adjusting, as I needed to make sure to point it to look at the correct 7 spaces as the ones that should exist. After that, it was just confirming that everything worked. I found I needed to adjust the index for the 7 spaces only 5 forwards so it would correctly detect the next word start, and then it seemed to work as intended. It is not too flexible with the laws of morse code, and adheres to them as described fairly precisly. It has potential to have issues if things are not entered correctly, but has a return so that it should avoid special characters. It tries to detect what mode it is in, by looking at the first character, as no word starts with a "-" or "." that I know of. It then will follow checking those characters as they are in morse or english for the rest of the input string. It will convert all english to upper case as no lower case letters exist in morse code.
